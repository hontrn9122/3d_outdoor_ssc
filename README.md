# 3D Outdoor Semantic Scene Completion for Autonomous Driving

This repo contains the official code for my Capstone Project: 3D Semantic Scene Completion for Autonomous Driving.

<!-- ## Description

In this project, I improve the SSA-SC model by Yang et al. ([arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11453)) by introducing 3 new modules to the baseline.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* torch
* lightning
* torch_geometric
* wandb


### Executing program

We are currently providing experiment codes in Jupyter notebooks. The running scripts will be provided in the future.
